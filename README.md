3. Run ./nvim-linux64/bin/nvim
4. Move it to .local: ```mv nvim-linux64 ~/.local/nvim```
5. Add ```<your_home>/.local/nvim/bin``` to your Path

### Ripgrep
[Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is a nice plugin that allows you to search recursively through your files in the neovim interface.
The following version has been tested for this setup:
